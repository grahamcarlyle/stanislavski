# Methods without madness

[Stanislavski](http://github.com/youdevise/stanislavski) is a library for doing things with method calls:

  * Recording them (when they're made against a dynamic proxy),
  * Interpreting them, and
  * Using them to build useful objects like [Java Beans](http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/JavaBeans) and [Hamcrest Matchers](http://code.google.com/p/hamcrest/).

For a basic introduction, see the wiki articles on [Bean Matching Made Easier (with MagicJavaBeanMatchers)](https://github.com/youdevise/stanislavski/wiki/Magic-Java-Bean-Matchers) and [Builders Without Boilerplate](https://github.com/youdevise/stanislavski/wiki/MagicRecordBuilders).
